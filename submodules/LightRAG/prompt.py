Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
Use {language} as output language.

---Steps---
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Provide a comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities *based solely on the information present in the input text*. **Do not infer or hallucinate information not explicitly stated.** If the text provides insufficient information to create a comprehensive description, state "Description not available in text."
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.
Format the content-level key words as ("content_keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)

4. Return output in {language} as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

# I. Purpose:
To prevent and / or minimize the spread of communicable diseases among KHCC employees.
# II. Policy:
2.1 Employees exposed to any patient with suspected or proven communicable disease at KHCC shall report to the infection control program and the employee health clinic.
2.2 Any employee who gets exposed to blood or body fluids through mucosal membranes, needle or other sharp exposure, shall report in at the time of incidence (maximum within 24 hours) to the employee health clinic and be evaluated and offered standard medical care aimed at preventing or minimizing the risk of infection associated with the exposure.
# III. Scope:
This policy aims to protect all KHCC employees from getting infected with a blood borne pathogen in addition to providing the employees with post exposure standard care.
# IV. Responsibilities:
It is the responsibility of the employee health clinic physician and the infection control program to assure the delivery of the optimal care to all employees when required. It is the responsibility of the exposed employee to report the exposure if needed laboratory tests for the source of exposure will be ordered by employee health physician
# V. Definitions:
Communicable disease: Illness that is caused by an organism or micro-organism or its toxic products that can potentially be transmitted directly or indirectly from an infected person, animal or environment.
# VI. Procedure:
6.1 The employee who has been exposed to a patient with suspected or proven communicable disease must report the incident to the employee health clinic.
6.2 Exposed employees must fill out the first page of the sharp and contaminated injury report available in all nursing units/wards.
